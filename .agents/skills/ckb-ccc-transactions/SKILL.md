description: Covers composing and sending CKB transactions with CCC — building transaction outputs, completing inputs and fees, adding cell dependencies, and querying the chain (cells by lock, balance, transaction confirmation). Use when the user asks how to build, compose, or send a transaction, add cell deps, or query on-chain data — even if they just say "transfer CKB" or "check this transaction" without naming CCC methods. UDT and Spore transfers build on this pattern; see ckb-ccc-udt / ckb-ccc-spore for those specifics. Requires a connected Signer — see ckb-ccc-signer-setup if one hasn't been created yet.

# CKB CCC — Transactions

The canonical CCC transaction pattern. This applies to plain CKB transfers and is the foundation that `ckb-ccc-udt` and `ckb-ccc-spore` build on top of — those skills only cover what's different for their asset type, not the full pattern again.

You need a connected `Signer` before any of this — see `ckb-ccc-signer-setup`.

---

## Standard transaction composition pattern

1. **Resolve recipient** — `const { script: lock } = await ccc.Address.fromString(toAddress, signer.client)`.
2. **Build transaction** — `const tx = ccc.Transaction.from({ outputs: [{ capacity: ccc.fixedPointFrom("100"), lock }] })`.
3. **Complete inputs** — `await tx.completeInputsByCapacity(signer)` — must come before fee calculation.
4. **Pay fee** — `await tx.completeFeeBy(signer)` — omit fee rate argument to use automatic network rate.
5. **Send** — `const txHash = await signer.sendTransaction(tx)`.
6. **Verify** — Optionally wait for confirmation: `await signer.client.waitTransaction(txHash, 1)`.

**This order is mandatory**: `outputs declared → completeInputsByCapacity → completeFeeBy → sendTransaction`.
Calling `completeFeeBy` before `completeInputsByCapacity` produces an incorrect fee.

---

## Cell Dep Management

```typescript
// Add deps for built-in scripts (preferred)
await tx.addCellDepsOfKnownScripts(client, ccc.KnownScript.XUdt);

// Add custom cell dep
tx.addCellDeps({ outPoint: { txHash: "0x...", index: 0 }, depType: "depGroup" });
```

`signer.prepareTransaction()` (called automatically inside `sendTransaction`) adds
deps for the signer's own lock script. Do not add them again manually.

---

## Querying the Chain

```typescript
// Iterate cells by lock script (async generator — streams lazily)
for await (const cell of client.findCellsByLock(lockScript, null, true)) {
  console.log(cell.outPoint, cell.cellOutput.capacity);
}

// Wait for transaction confirmation
await client.waitTransaction(txHash, 1); // 1 confirmation, 60s timeout default

// Get balance
const balance = await signer.getBalance(); // total Shannon across all addresses
```

---

## Gotchas (transaction-specific)

| Symptom / Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `"not enough capacity"` | Total input capacity doesn't cover outputs + fee  | Fund the address, or confirm `completeInputsByCapacity` is called before `completeFeeBy` so CCC collects enough inputs automatically |
| Transaction rejected by node | Fee too low or missing | Call `completeFeeBy` after `completeInputsByCapacity`; if a second argument (explicit `feeRate`) is passed, check it's not below `1000n` (the node's default `min_fee_rate`) — bump to `2000n`/`4000n` if rejections persist. Omit the argument entirely to let CCC calculate the network rate automatically. |
| `addCellDepsOfKnownScripts is not a function` | Wrong import or outdated version | Use `@ckb-ccc/shell` not `@ckb-ccc/core` for backend; update CCC to latest |

## Hallucination Guard

- ❌ `new ccc.Transaction()` — always use `ccc.Transaction.from({ outputs: [...] })`
- ❌ Manually computing fees — always use `completeFeeBy`
- ❌ Manually selecting input cells — always use `completeInputsByCapacity`
- ❌ Calling `completeFeeBy` before `completeInputsByCapacity` — order is mandatory
- ❌ `tx.addCellDepsOfKnownScripts` without `await` — it's async

---

## Checklist (transaction-specific)

- [ ] **Transaction order** — `outputs declared → completeInputsByCapacity → completeFeeBy → sendTransaction`
- [ ] **Capacity** — Output capacity is calculated from each output's lock, type script, and data (use CCC helpers, not manual calculation)
- [ ] **Fee rate** — `completeFeeBy` called without explicit rate (automatic) unless a custom rate is needed; if custom, ensure it's ≥ `1000n` (node's `min_fee_rate`), recommend `2000n`.
- [ ] **Error handling** — `try/catch` around `sendTransaction`

Also check the cross-cutting checklist in `ckb-ccc-fundamentals`.
